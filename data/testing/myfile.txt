Chinese biotech company WuXi AppTec Co. dived Monday after shareholders unveiled plans to sell up to 65 million shares.
Shares hit their 10% daily downside limit in Shanghai, while those in Hong Kong were 9.1% lower.
The selloff came after WuXi AppTec, one of China's largest biotech companies, said late Friday that a group of shareholders controlled by and acting in concert with the company's de facto controller plans to dispose of an up to 2.2% stake. The selling shareholders currently hold a combined 24.07% stake.
WuXi said the disposal, expected from December, is due to the shareholders' own capital needs.
In June, the same group of shareholders said they will sell an up to 3% stake, sending WuXi's Shanghai-listed shares tumbling 9.6% in one day. Its Hong Kong stock plummeted 11% in the session following the disposal plans.
WuXi's shares have lost 48% and 37% in Hong Kong and Shanghai, respectively, so far this year. But the stock has regained some ground in recent weeks. Before Monday's drop, its Hong Kong shares were 23% higher in November, while the Shanghai-listed stock rose 7.3% in the same period.

Orbit Discovery is pleased to announce the commencement of a partnership with WuXi AppTec, a leading global provider of R&D and manufacturing services.
Orbit Discovery (Orbit), a ground-breaking peptide discovery company is pleased to announce the commencement of a partnership with WuXi AppTec, a leading global provider of R&D and manufacturing services that enable the global pharmaceutical and healthcare industry.
Orbit will combine its leading peptide discovery platform and experience with WuXi AppTec’s downstream capabilities. Specifically, Orbit gains access to WuXi AppTec’s expertise in peptide optimisation, peptide production and manufacturing to help its Partners obtain clinically relevant data packs and materials in a rapid timeframe. Orbit will also utilise other capabilities within WuXi AppTec, in particular their expertise in cell line and assay development and biophysical analysis.
Incorporating these capabilities into the Orbit platform will enable functional assays to be developed against a wider range of targets, facilitating direct functional screens using novel bead-based technologies and microfluidics.
This is the first strategic technology link Orbit has penned since its formation in 2016. The partnership underlines the commitment of the new management team to deliver ground-breaking technology and broader capabilities to the Partners engaged in applying the Company’s technology for the discovery of peptide therapeutic leads.
“We aim to move Orbit to the forefront of peptide discovery, and relationships such as this help us leverage expertise that would take far longer to grow organically. We see the partnership with WuXi AppTec as being a key relationship and a great asset to our current Partners, and Partners of the future.” He added: “We see particular value in the development and manufacturing platform of WuXi AppTec, that will enable us to generate peptides at small or large scale that incorporate chemical modifications to facilitate peptide optimisations and the journey towards a therapeutic candidate.” Dr Neil Butt, Chief Executive Officer of Orbit Discovery
“We are very pleased to have the opportunity to support Orbit Discovery and its research partners” commented Dr Dave Madge, VP Discovery Services at WuXi AppTec. “We see substantial synergies between the Orbit technology for peptide discovery and our platform for optimisation, characterisation and manufacture of novel peptide therapeutics.”

2022-03-08T08:34:00WuXi AppTec trials Crescent’s Nucleus Network, bids due
First round bids are due in this week for Crescent Capital’s Nucleus Labs, and it’s set to be a showdown between PE and strategic buyers.
WuXi, which is listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, is worth close to $90 billion. Clearly, if it wanted to have a swing, it would have the capacity to go hard.
The big question over its interest could be FIRB approval. Bids out of Shanghai and Hong Kong for Australian companies have all but dried up in recent years, as there could be some sensitivity around Nucleus and its patient data.
Morgan Stanley has been pitching Nucleus as a $40 million a year business, in terms of forecast EBITDA, with most of its revenue from customers in the US and Asia. It is expected to be worth 15 to 20 times EBITDA, or more, putting its valuation at upwards of $600 million.
Its presence in both Australia and the US is a selling point for the company. It specialises in phase one clinical trials and was involved in testing COVID-19 vaccines.
Interestingly, one of the strategics that would normally be sniffing around Nucleus Network is TPG Capital’s Novotech, which missed out to Crescent Capital a few years back.
Novotech’s now trying to list in Hong Kong, and you would have to think it would be too much to try to secure a chunky bolt-on deal while running an IPO campaign.

White-hot sector
WuXi was named as a comparable stock for Novotech in pre-deal reports blasted to investors in Asia, which highlighted the 98 times price earnings multiple it fetches.
Locally, theBurnet Institute’s sale of 360biolabs, which went for about $400 million or a 20 times price earnings, also showed momentum is with strategic bidders.
Other big CROs internationally include US-based multinational companies Laboratory Corporation of America, Parexel, IQVIA and Syneos Health.
In July Parexel proved that you can’t count PE buyer out, when it was announced the firm would be acquired by EGT and Goldman Sachs Asset Management from Pamplona Capital Management. In four years, Pamplona turned its $US4.5 billion purchase into a $US8.5 billion asset.
For Crescent, the sale of Nucleus comes only a few months after it listed one of its other healthcare assets - pathology business Australian Clinical Labs.
Earlier this year it also sold off medical centres business Myhealth Medical Group to Medibank Private.

Aptamer Group Limited, the developer of Optimer™ therapeutics and diagnostics, and WuXi AppTec Research Service Division, an integrated chemistry and biology research platform, today announce a research collaboration to identify new Optimer™-enabled therapeutics.
Aptamer Group Limited, the developer of Optimer™ therapeutics and diagnostics, and WuXi AppTec Research Service Division, an integrated chemistry and biology research platform, today announce a research collaboration to identify new Optimer™-enabled therapeutics.
The collaboration will aim to identify Optimers for use as Optimer-drug conjugates for targeted delivery of diverse payloads to new cellular targets. Achieving targeted delivery of drugs to specific tissues and organs can increase the therapeutic dose at site of action to increase therapeutic efficacy, and reduce off-target effects to improve patient tolerability. This remains a major translational challenge for many new precision medicines.
As part of the agreement, Aptamer Group will develop Optimers to specific disease biomarkers and supply them to WuXi AppTec Research Service Division for further evaluation as potential delivery vehicles.
